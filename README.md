I’m thrilled to unveil my new Flask-based web application that predicts diseases based on user symptoms! 🎉

Project Highlights:

🔍 Disease Prediction: Utilizes a pre-trained model to classify diseases from a set of symptoms provided by the user.

📚 Comprehensive Data: Integrates detailed datasets on symptoms, precautions, medications, diets, and workouts to offer tailored recommendations.

🌐 User-Friendly Interface: Designed with Flask to provide an intuitive and interactive web experience.

Key Features:

Predictive Model: Uses a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to make accurate disease predictions.
Dynamic Recommendations: Provides actionable insights including disease descriptions, precautionary measures, recommended medications, dietary suggestions, and workout plans.
Seamless Integration: Easy to set up with a requirements.txt file for smooth installation of dependencies.

💡 Technologies Used:

Flask for web development
Pandas and NumPy for data handling
Scikit-learn for machine learning
HTML/CSS for frontend design
Special Thanks to everyone who supported me through this project and provided valuable feedback!
